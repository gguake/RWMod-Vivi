<VV_LetterViviEggHatched>A new Vivi has hatched from the egg laid by {PARENT_labelShort}.</VV_LetterViviEggHatched>
<VV_LetterViviEggHatchedNoParent>A new Vivi has been born. Vivi grows faster than typical humans and can grow even more quickly through special food.
\nIf Vivi consumes enough royal jelly during its growth stages, it will mature into a Royal Vivi; otherwise, it will grow into a regular Vivi.
\nRoyal Vivi can reproduce, but be cautious as it could potentially become a threat if the settlement does not meet sufficient conditions.</VV_LetterViviEggHatchedNoParent>
