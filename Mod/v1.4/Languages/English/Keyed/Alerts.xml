<VV_AlertArtificialPlantLowEnergy>very low energy</VV_AlertArtificialPlantLowEnergy>
<VV_AlertArtificialPlantLowEnergyDesc>The energy held by the plant is very low. If left neglected in a depleted energy state, it will gradually become damaged and eventually be destroyed.
\nEnsure the plant has an environment where it can gain energy, or place it next to a plant that produces more energy than its maximum capacity. You can also recharge its energy by applying fertilizer.
\nIf conditions do not allow for recharging energy, you can package it to prevent damage.</VV_AlertArtificialPlantLowEnergyDesc>
