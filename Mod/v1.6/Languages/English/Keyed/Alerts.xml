<VV_Alert_GrowingArcanePlantLowHPDesc>The health of the cultivated arcane plants is low. If the health reaches zero during cultivation, the cultivation fails and the consumed resources are not returned.
The health of the plant can decrease if the cultivation conditions are not suitable, there is a lack of mana, or the management tasks are not performed in time.
If all cultivation conditions are met, the health of the plant will slowly recover.</VV_Alert_GrowingArcanePlantLowHPDesc>
