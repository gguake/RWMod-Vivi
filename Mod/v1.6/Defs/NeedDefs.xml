    <description>The total amount of royal jelly a Vivi eats affects how it grows. If a Vivi is fully fed by the time it grows up, it becomes a Royal Vivi; if not, it stays a regular Vivi.
\nRoyal Vivis can reproduce and are good at interacting and have high psychic sensitivity, but they are not as good at working.</description>
