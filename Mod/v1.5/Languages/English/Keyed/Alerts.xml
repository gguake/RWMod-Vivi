<VV_AlertArcanePlantLowManaDesc>The mana held by the plant is very low. If left neglected in a depleted mana state, it will gradually become damaged and eventually be destroyed.
\nEnsure the plant has an environment where it can gain mana, or place it next to a plant that produces more mana than its maximum capacity. You can also recharge its mana by applying fertilizer.
\nIf conditions do not allow for recharging mana, you can package it to prevent damage.</VV_AlertArcanePlantLowManaDesc>
