<VV_Letter_ViviEggHatchedNoParent>A new Vivi has been born. Vivi grows faster than typical humans and can grow even more quickly through special food.

\nRoyal Vivi can reproduce, but be cautious as it could potentially become a threat if the settlement does not meet sufficient conditions.</VV_Letter_ViviEggHatchedNoParent>
