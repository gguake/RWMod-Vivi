    <description>A race similar to a kind of fairy that lives a lifestyle similar to bees.
\nTheir origin is unknown, but their lifestyle is mostly similar to bees, and unlike normal humans, they reproduce through parthenogenesis, and are known to have their unique mode of communication and a short lifespan.
\nVivi genes are abnormally prone to mutations compared to other creatures, so it is common to be born with random mutated genes. For this reason, despite parthenogenesis, they show a diverse genetic distribution.
\nTypically, Vivis live only near their nests, so they are not commonly seen outside, but occasionally you can see Vivi who wander to create new nests.</description>
